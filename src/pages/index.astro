        <div class="prose prose-lg max-w-none">
          <p class="mb-4">
            Kailash Research Foundation (KRF) was born out of a legacy quietly built, not declared. My grandparents believed that the most profound impact is made not through words, but through the way one lives. Their lives were defined by acts of generosity and integrity that asked for no recognition, yet left deep, lasting imprints on the people around them. KRF is my way of carrying forward that tradition, grounded in altruism, sustained by action.
          </p>
          <p class="mb-4">
            On the field, these challenges never stand alone — they are intertwined with caste, religion, and social inequities, creating complex realities that demand solutions built on a scientific approach and a deep understanding of people's lived realities.
          </p>
          <p>
            KRF rests on a simple belief: change is not enough — evolution is the goal. change makes things work a little better; evolution reshapes them so they no longer carry the same flaws. Our work is to design systems that are inclusive, resilient, and built to endure — systems that not only resolve today's challenges but open the way for communities to thrive on their own in the future.
